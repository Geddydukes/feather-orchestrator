# Feather Orchestrator Memory System Implementation Plan

## Vision and Objectives
- Deliver a production-grade conversational memory subsystem that supports multi-session context, smart compression, and multiple persistence backends (Redis, PostgreSQL, in-memory) with developer-friendly TypeScript APIs.
- Achieve enterprise readiness via monitoring, rate limiting, security, and compliance features while ensuring strong developer experience and documentation.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Session-oriented design** – every interaction scoped to a session with optional user isolation.
2. **Backend abstraction** – unified `MemoryManager` interface with pluggable implementations.
3. **Context intelligence** – automatic compression, summarization, and hybrid retrieval to respect model token budgets.
4. **Production hardening** – TTL, rate limits, observability, error handling, and compliance controls baked in.
5. **Developer delight** – simple configuration, strong typing, comprehensive docs, and actionable errors.

## Phase & Week Breakdown

### Weeks 1-2 – Core Interface & In-Memory Baseline
**Goals**
- Define TypeScript interfaces and domain models for sessions, messages, and context windows.
- Implement `InMemoryMemoryManager` to unblock integration and testing.
- Establish context compression strategies and token accounting utilities.
- Integrate baseline memory support into Feather orchestrator flows.

**Key Tasks**
1. **Domain Modeling**
   - Define `MemoryMessage`, `SessionMemory`, and `MemoryContext` types.
   - Create `MemoryManager` interface covering CRUD operations, context retrieval, compression hooks, and metrics reporting.
   - Document expected async behavior, error contracts, and configuration options.
2. **In-Memory Implementation**
   - Implement `InMemoryMemoryManager` with configurable limits (max messages, TTL simulation, optional compression hooks).
   - Provide deterministic serialization for unit testing.
3. **Context Compression Utilities**
   - Implement summarization (LLM-powered interface, placeholder for now), truncation, hybrid combine logic, and token counting helpers (using tokenizer integration).
4. **Feather Integration**
   - Add configuration entry point to select memory backend and register per-session usage.
   - Wire baseline telemetry hooks (events fired but not yet persisted).
5. **Testing & Docs**
   - Unit tests covering interface contract, compression utilities, and in-memory flows.
   - Draft quick-start documentation snippet showing basic usage.

### Weeks 3-4 – Redis Backend & Performance Enhancements
**Goals**
- Deliver production-ready Redis-backed memory with TTL, compression, and monitoring support.
- Optimize context retrieval and persistence for low latency.

**Key Tasks**
1. **Redis Schema & Data Access Layer**
   - Define key structure: `memory:{tenant}:{session}` for message lists, sorted by timestamp/sequence.
   - Store compressed contexts alongside raw messages for fast retrieval; configure per-session TTL.
   - Implement Lua scripts or pipelines for atomic append + trim.
2. **RedisMemoryManager Implementation**
   - Add constructor accepting Redis client, TTL defaults, compression strategy, rate limiting hooks.
   - Support lazy loading and pagination via `LRANGE` and `ZSET` indexes if needed.
3. **Context Compression Integration**
   - Enable background summarization job (async queue) for large histories.
   - Store both raw and summary segments; deliver hybrid context based on token budget.
4. **Monitoring & Metrics Foundations**
   - Emit metrics (latency, hit rate, compression ratio) via open telemetry hooks.
   - Log structured errors with correlation IDs.
5. **Testing**
   - Integration tests against local Redis container covering TTL expiry, concurrency, failure scenarios.
   - Load testing harness to benchmark 1k concurrent sessions (baseline target).

### Weeks 5-6 – PostgreSQL Backend & Advanced Features
**Goals**
- Provide durable relational storage with schema migrations, indexing, and compliance features.
- Introduce advanced management features (partitioning, retention policies).

**Key Tasks**
1. **Schema Design**
   - Tables: `sessions`, `messages`, `summaries`, `audit_logs`.
   - Use JSONB columns for metadata, indexes on `(tenant_id, session_id, created_at)`.
   - Support partitioning by tenant or creation month for scalability.
2. **PostgresMemoryManager**
   - Implement data mapper layer with connection pooling, transactional appends, and optimistic concurrency.
   - Provide query APIs for paginated retrieval and hybrid summary fetching.
   - Integrate retention policies via scheduled jobs / triggers.
3. **Compliance & Security Enhancements**
   - Encrypt sensitive columns via pgcrypto or application-level encryption.
   - Add per-tenant access controls and soft-delete functionality for GDPR compliance.
4. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Implement retry/backoff strategies, circuit breaker wrapper, and detailed error types.
5. **Testing**
   - Integration tests with real Postgres, covering migrations, partitioning, retention, and error paths.
   - Chaos testing scripts to simulate network partitions/timeouts.

### Weeks 7-8 – Production Hardening, Monitoring, Documentation
**Goals**
- Finalize production features: monitoring dashboards, rate limiting, compliance tooling, developer documentation, and release prep.

**Key Tasks**
1. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Implement metrics collectors (latency, throughput, compression ratio, error rates) and export to Prometheus.
   - Build dashboard templates (Grafana) and alerting rules.
2. **Rate Limiting & Quotas**
   - Introduce rate-limiting middleware per session/user, leveraging Redis counters.
   - Document configuration and provide guardrail error responses.
3. **Security & Privacy Finalization**
   - Automatic PII detection/redaction pipeline with configurable classifiers.
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (KMS integration) and ensure secure transport.
   - Implement audit logging with tamper-proof storage for SOC2 alignment.
4. **Documentation & Developer Experience**
   - Produce comprehensive guides: Quick Start, configuration, backend setup, performance tuning, troubleshooting.
   - Generate TypeDoc API reference with examples.
   - Publish migration and upgrade notes.
5. **Testing & Release Preparation**
   - Final load testing, regression suite, and resilience validation.
   - Establish CI pipelines, artifacts, and release checklist.
   - Conduct beta with selected customers and collect feedback.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Smart Context Management Strategy
- **Summarization**: integrate pluggable LLM summarizers; store incremental summaries per N messages.
- **Truncation**: enforce configurable token/message caps with oldest-first trimming.
- **Hybrid approach**: combine recent verbatim messages with summary digests for depth.
- **Token Counting**: integrate tokenizer adapters (OpenAI tiktoken, Anthropic, etc.) for budget estimation.

### Production Feature Support
- **TTL & Retention**: configurable per backend; implement background cleanup jobs.
- **Compression**: configurable gzip/brotli for stored contexts; evaluate dictionary-based compression for large histories.
- **Monitoring**: unify metrics API across backends; integrate with Feather telemetry bus.
- **Rate Limiting**: abstract limiter interface to reuse across backends.
- **Error Handling**: standardized error hierarchy with actionable messages and remediation hints.

### Security & Compliance
- Enforce tenant isolation, RBAC policies, and encryption at rest (KMS-managed keys where applicable).
- Provide data export/delete APIs for GDPR compliance, with audit trails.
- Integrate automated PII detection with configurable redaction or blocking policies.

### Performance & Scalability
- Optimize serialization, leverage pipelining/batching, and use caching for hot contexts.
- Support horizontal scaling (sharded Redis, partitioned Postgres) and asynchronous background processing.
- Monitor compression ratios and adjust thresholds to maintain target token budgets.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests for each backend.
- Performance/load test harness with reproducible scenarios.
- Failure injection tests (network partitions, timeouts, out-of-memory) with documented recovery behavior.
- Continuous benchmarking to ensure SLA compliance (<10ms typical operations).

### Documentation & Developer Enablement
- Maintain living docs alongside code with clear change logs.
- Provide TypeScript examples, SDK snippets, and end-to-end tutorials.
- Offer troubleshooting matrix and FAQ covering backend-specific issues.
